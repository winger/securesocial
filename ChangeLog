		- PasswordHasher and Password validator are abstract classes instead of traits now (simplifies Java integration).
		- Fixed: wrong LinkedIn key for getting fullName (thanks @chazmcgarvey).
		- Removed servceInfo from OAuth1Info. That object can be retrieved from SecureSocial.serviceInfoFor method now.
		- Backward incompatible changes to the Java API: deleted AuthenticationMethod, OAuth1Info, OAuth2Info, PasswordInfo, SocialUser and UserId. This was required because after introducing the Identity trait I need to make sure the user gets its own object in the actions instead of a SocialUser instance.  Even though there's not a Java equivalent, the Scala classes can be called from Java easily.
		- Added new message to messages file: securesocial.login.errorLoggingIn
		- Improved ProviderController.handleAuth to show an error if an error occurrs while logging the user in (eg: if the UserService.save implemewntation throws an exception)
		- Fixed: Identity providers were filling wrong provider id values
		- Added: UsernamePasswordProvider updates the user avatar if gravatar support is enabled now.
		- Added timeout for sessions (30 mins by default, use sessionTimeOut property to change). 
		- Fixed: PasswordValidator was not being used in password reset
		- Fixed: When a token is expired the user is properly redirected to the sign up or reset pages now
		- Added enableTokenJob property to enable/disable the background job
		- Fixed method typo AuthenticationMethod: toScala.
		- Right http codes are returned for ajax calls now 
		- New assetsController property to override the assets class in RoutesHelper. Needed when a custom Asset controller is used by the app.  
		- Added hasher id to PasswordInfo
		- Added support for registering multiple PasswordHashers to allow upgrading the hashing algorithm.
		- Introduced Identity trait. SocialUser now implements it (this will allow developers to return their own user class from UserService.find methods)
